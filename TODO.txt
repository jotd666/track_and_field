- hammer: hammer sprite direction sometimes wrong (when launching): sprite symmetry flags
- javelin displays strangely/seems shifted/ground when landing: when reaching max height
  it seems to shift to the bottom by a few pixels (possible transcode issue again...)
- cycle exact: sprites blinking despite double buffering
=> publish video

- add cheats to be able to pass all levels (and rip the podium part!)
- propagate all player used frames for CLUTS 0,1,2,3
- try to get the spider/bird in javelin: ok works but flashes
- rip sounds
- rip tunes
- cpu erase not working (disabled right now, maybe buggy in Gyruss too?)
  still artefacts remaining sometimes seems that blitter busy makes erase fail!!
- is game playing: not working (should be able to insert coin in the push start screen)
- save NV RAM each time a record is broken (find when) or game is over
- sound and music!
- converter: GET_DP_ADDRESS	0x95                    	| [$9a2d: cmpd   $95]
	cmp.w	(a0),d1   => macro!

optims:
- scroll optim: only change copperlist if previous value is different
- group sprites horizontally
- optimize code manually in the end
