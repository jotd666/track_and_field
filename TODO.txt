- Chariots of fire music pattern restarts too soon
- leave more room for all tunes (so I can stop them not too accurately)
- copperlist interrupt too soon (flickering?)
- test attached sprites for main characters
- option to enable the second joystick
- maybe read joystick directions & button in the half frame with classic
  joystick & fire button read
- test update chars @ 25 fps but sprites @50 for floppy nofast
- cycle exact: sprites blinking despite double buffering:
- cpu erase not working (disabled right now, maybe buggy in Gyruss too?)
  still artefacts remaining sometimes seems that blitter busy makes erase fail!!
- converter: GET_DP_ADDRESS	0x95                    	| [$9a2d: cmpd   $95]
	cmp.w	(a0),d1   => macro!

1. On my A1200 (64 meg with 030)  the WHD version hangs and gives garbage
   before the welcome screen.

log sounds: bpset 66F4,,{print A;g}
sim sound on credit: bpset 66F4,,{A=$12;g}

chrono_hundredth_second_7e = 0x7e
chrono_second_7f = 0x7f
