- clarify why previous positions need nb sprites * 2 else it crashes!
- remove "ticks" in music and use E8x command: debug Karate Cahmp first
- try to fake 100+ meters on the javelin
- leave more room for all tunes (so I can stop them not too accurately): test it
- option to enable the second joystick
- test update chars @ 25 fps but sprites @50 for floppy nofast
- cpu erase not working (disabled right now, maybe buggy in Gyruss too?)
  still artefacts remaining sometimes seems that blitter busy makes erase fail!!
- converter: GET_DP_ADDRESS	0x95                    	| [$9a2d: cmpd   $95]
	cmp.w	(a0),d1   => macro!
