- if bob called "player" & no mirror, create an attached sprite entry (32 pixels)
  (check memory, can be reduced to running/jumping frames!!)
  each frame:
  if bob can be a sprite, allocate it. If not possible bob remains a bob
  IN PROgRESS
  
- check when run/hurdles records are stored in MAME... seems NEVER
- leave more room for all tunes (so I can stop them not too accurately): test it
- test attached sprites for 2 first main characters (made of 2 sprites each)
- option to enable the second joystick
- maybe read joystick directions & button in the half frame with classic
  joystick & fire button read
- test update chars @ 25 fps but sprites @50 for floppy nofast
- cycle exact: sprites blinking despite double buffering: test after hw sprite
- cpu erase not working (disabled right now, maybe buggy in Gyruss too?)
  still artefacts remaining sometimes seems that blitter busy makes erase fail!!
