- OCS: trashed sprites on the right: sprite adjust issue?
- OCS: speed bar re-turn to blue then white again 
- maybe setting per level?
- create several control settings like "up" to jump/throw and fire/blue for left/right

- sub.w/add.w in the code
- clarify why previous positions need nb sprites * 2 else it crashes!
- cpu erase not working (disabled right now, maybe buggy in Gyruss too?)
  still artefacts remaining sometimes seems that blitter busy makes erase fail!!
- mole bonus not triggered on high jump (or maybe it works)
