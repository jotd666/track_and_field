**** CPU conversion issue!! *****
- 100m dash: cpu player "jumps" in x position
- long jump: 2 girl sprites in the background don't move with scrolling
- 110m hurdles demo seems to never end... retest
- high jump/long jump/javelin: character/javelin rises and rises...
**** CPU conversion issue!! *****

ebe4: masking out kills D, use tmp d6, remove masking out
eca3: leax b,x: should mask out and use tmp d6 too

- erase: error if blitter busy?
- player frame wrong symmetry in tiles
- converter: GET_DP_ADDRESS	0x95                    	| [$9a2d: cmpd   $95]
	cmp.w	(a0),d1   => macro!
- converter: .global	cpu_init in include
- converter: built-in LOG_REGS (avec commentaire ENABLE_LOG_REGS)

- cpu erase not working (disabled right now, maybe buggy in Gyruss too?)
  still artefacts remaining sometimes
- scroll optim: only change copperlist if previous value is different
- group sprites horizontally
- optimize code manually in the end
