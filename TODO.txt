- cycle exact: sprites blinking despite double buffering

- https://tcrf.net/Track_%26_Field_(Arcade) restore original settings
  centuri game is too hard
- rip run sounds: let one player play
- cpu erase not working (disabled right now, maybe buggy in Gyruss too?)
  still artefacts remaining sometimes seems that blitter busy makes erase fail!!
- is game playing: not working (should be able to insert coin in the push start screen)
- save NV RAM each time a record is broken (find when) or game is over
- sound and music!
- converter: GET_DP_ADDRESS	0x95                    	| [$9a2d: cmpd   $95]
	cmp.w	(a0),d1   => macro!

optims:
- optimize code manually in the end
