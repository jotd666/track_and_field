- OCS: use HW sprites for background characters, referees ... if 16-pixel wide
- OCS: trashed sprites on the right: sprite adjust issue?
- OCS: green dots => cyan and red dots (of tracks) => some other color 
  and change with copper to re-create bi-color grass/track
  restore brown too for red??
- maybe setting per level?
- create several control settings like "up" to jump/throw and fire/blue for left/right

- post-processing optimize GET_DP_ADDRESS  xx + move.b xx,(a0) ou clr.b (a0) ou move.b (a0),xx
- clarify why previous positions need nb sprites * 2 else it crashes!
- cpu erase not working (disabled right now, maybe buggy in Gyruss too?)
  still artefacts remaining sometimes seems that blitter busy makes erase fail!!
- mole bonus not triggered on high jump
