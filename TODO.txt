- hammer: hammer sprite direction sometimes wrong (when launching): sprite symmetry flags
- converter: GET_DP_ADDRESS	0x95                    	| [$9a2d: cmpd   $95]
	cmp.w	(a0),d1   => macro!

- sound and music!
- X=0: sprite not displayed. If displayed, artefacts appear!
- cpu erase not working (disabled right now, maybe buggy in Gyruss too?)
  still artefacts remaining sometimes seems that blitter busy makes erase fail!!

optims:
- scroll optim: only change copperlist if previous value is different
- group sprites horizontally
- optimize code manually in the end
