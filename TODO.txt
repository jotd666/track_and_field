**** CPU conversion issue!! *****
- 100m dash: cpu player "jumps" in x position
- long jump: 2 girl sprites in the background don't move with scrolling
- 100m dash: even when qualifying with lower time, race lost unless CPU wins!
 => because 2960 value gets overwritten after finish line DEBUG THIS <====
- 110m hurdles demo seems to never end...
- high jump: character rises and rises...
- long jump demo/game doesn't work properly: foul each time
**** CPU conversion issue!! *****

- player frame wrong symmetry in tiles
- converter: GET_DP_ADDRESS	0x95                    	| [$9a2d: cmpd   $95]
	cmp.w	(a0),d1   => macro!
- converter: .global	cpu_init in include


- cpu erase not working (disabled right now, maybe buggy in Gyruss too?)
  still artefacts remaining sometimes
- scroll optim: only change copperlist if previous value is different
- group sprites horizontally
- optimize code manually in the end
