- avoid 2 first & last tile rows!
- scrolling: double tile write to simulate wrap
- scrolling: shifted rows (dash)
- tiles corrupt (dash/hurdles)
- timer corrupt
- sprites update at least to log them!
- reapply the +2 trick to clip left sprites: no, shift bob planes then add X to bobs
- group sprites horizontally
- converter: GET_DP_ADDRESS	0x95                    	| [$9a2d: cmpd   $95]
	cmp.w	(a0),d1   => macro!
- converter: .global	cpu_init in include
- cpu erase not working (disabled right now, maybe buggy in Gyruss too?)
  still artefacts remaining sometimes
