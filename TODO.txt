- complete OCS version
  => tiles palette to rework: browns => red, blue => leave, white => leave
  => chars seem shifted (but not for all cluts???): ex "AAA" => OK, but START => TUBSU
- clarify why previous positions need nb sprites * 2 else it crashes!
- test update chars @ 25 fps but sprites @50 for floppy nofast
- cpu erase not working (disabled right now, maybe buggy in Gyruss too?)
  still artefacts remaining sometimes seems that blitter busy makes erase fail!!
- mole bonus not triggered on high jump
