- mole bonus triggered on high jump, mole appears but missing the "nice" & 1000 points sprite
  also there's a crash report on the mole. 68000? the fact that some sprites don't
  show isn't a good sign
  debug more around E32A. Even with MAME it's difficult to trigger the mole...
  "the game hangs in high jump event if you try to get the mole (2 fouls and 3 good jump)"
  => so let's try 2 fouls, qualify at 1m90, first attempt at 1m80 and go
- fixed blitter routine issue (cornercase, to release)
- clarify why previous positions need nb sprites * 2 else it crashes!
- cpu erase not working (disabled right now, maybe buggy in Gyruss too?)
  still artefacts remaining sometimes seems that blitter busy makes erase fail!!
