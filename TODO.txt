- NTSC version doesn't seem to work either OCS or AGA, no key interrupts
  in name entry. Seems to run fine until a key is pressed... Try to start
  game with joystick just to see
- high jump right pole position is 1 pixel too far to the right
  probably a problem of sync with scrolling that is not visible in MAME
  (unless we go frame per frame!)
- clarify why previous positions need nb sprites * 2 else it crashes!
- cpu erase not working (disabled right now, maybe buggy in Gyruss too?)
  still artefacts remaining sometimes seems that blitter busy makes erase fail!!
