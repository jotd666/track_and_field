- cpu erase completely broken!
- hammer: hammer sprite direction sometimes wrong (when launching): sprite symmetry flags

=> publish video

- rip sounds
- rip tunes
- cpu erase not working (disabled right now, maybe buggy in Gyruss too?)
  still artefacts remaining sometimes seems that blitter busy makes erase fail!!
- is game playing: not working (should be able to insert coin in the push start screen)
- javelin displays strangely/seems shifted/ground when landing
- save NV RAM each time a record is broken (find when) or game is over
- sound and music!
- converter: GET_DP_ADDRESS	0x95                    	| [$9a2d: cmpd   $95]
	cmp.w	(a0),d1   => macro!

optims:
- scroll optim: only change copperlist if previous value is different
- group sprites horizontally
- optimize code manually in the end
